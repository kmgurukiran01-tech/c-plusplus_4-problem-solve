problem-statement:-
You need to complete the function and handle input so that the program works exactly as required.
​

Task
Read an integer N (size of the array).
​

Read N space-separated integers into the array arr.
​

Complete the arraySum(arr, N) function so that it:

Iterates through the array.

Computes the sum of all elements.

Returns that sum.
​

Print the returned sum as a single integer.
​

Example 1
Input:

N = 5

arr = 2 4 6 8 10
​

Output:

30

Task behavior:

Function calculates 2+4+6+8+10=30 and returns 30, which is printed.
​

Example 2
Input:

N = 5

arr = -6 1 3 7 5
​

Output:

10

Task behavior:

Function calculates [−6+1+3+7+5=10] and returns 10, which is printed.
